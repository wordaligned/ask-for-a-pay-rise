# L'Augmentation by Georges Perec

L'Augmentation is the tragi-comic story of a worker's heroic, pathetic, absurd but persistent attempts to ask their boss for a pay-rise.

Written originally for radio by Georges Perec in 1967, it has since been performed many times on stage. The story takes the form of a flow chart. By answering a series of yes/no questions the protagonist navigates through a series of increasingly frustrating encounters with Mr X and Ms Y. Is fish on the menu? Does one of Mr X's daughters have measles? Such details matter as negotiations continue.

The work is also available as an [interactive web page](http://www.theartofaskingyourbossforaraise.com).

I've created a [Python program](./ask-for-a-pay-rise.py) which you can run at the console:

   $ python ask-for-a-pay-rise.py

I've also [published a version](./index.js) to run on Amazon's Alexa voice computing platform. The backend is an AWS lambda function which uses the Alexa SDK. The frontend is an Alexa Skill.
